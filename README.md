# General Information

"I recently built a portfolio using React in order to improve my skills in the framework. The portfolio has an About page, a Projects page, and a Contacts page.

Building the portfolio was a great learning experience for me. I had to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and functionality of the website. I also used tools like React Router for handling navigation between pages and a styling library like Material-UI or styled-components for styling the UI.

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how React works and how to use its components, state management, and other features effectively in my projects. I'm proud of the portfolio I created and am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer with React."
